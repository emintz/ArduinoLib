/**
 * A one shot timer, a timer that runs once then stops. The construction
 * binds the timer to a TimeExpiredAction that it invokes when it expires.
 * A running timer can be stopped before it expires, in which case it
 * does NOT invoke its action.
 *
 * Note: Many public FreeRTOS timer API functions send commands to the
 *       timer service via the timer command queue, a private queue
 *       that application code cannot access. Like all queues, it has
 *       finite capacity so timer functions could wait indefinitely
 *       for queue space to become available. Users can specify a
 *       maximum waiting time. Since the underlying timer is based
 *       on queues, methods in this class are inherently thread-safe.
 *
 *       Be aware of race conditions, especially when delays can be
 *       zero. Consider a OneShotTimerH bound to a NotifyingTimerAction.
 *       The bound task will use the timer as follows:
 *
 *           one_shot_timer.start_ms(timeout_in_ms);
 *           wait_for_notification();
 *
 *       If timout_in_ms is 0, the start_ms() call could return before
 *       the invoking task can invoke wait_for_notification causing the
 *       task to wait for the maximum possible delay.
